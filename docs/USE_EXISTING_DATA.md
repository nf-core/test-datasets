Please fill in the appropriate checklist below (delete whatever is not relevant). These are the most common things requested when adding a new test dataset.

 - [ ] Check [here](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/branches/all) to find the branch corresponding to the test dataset you want to use
 - [ ] Specify in the test.config the path to the files from the test dataset
 - [ ] Set up your CI tests following the nf-core best practices (cf [.travis.yml template](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/dev/nf_core/pipeline-template/{{cookiecutter.name_noslash}}/.travis.yml))
