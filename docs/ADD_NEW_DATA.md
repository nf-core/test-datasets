# How to add and use new test dataset

Please fill in the appropriate checklist below (delete whatever is not relevant). These are the most common things requested when adding a new test dataset.

 - [x] Check [here](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/branches/all) that there isn't already a branch containing data that could be used
   - If this is the case, follow the [documentation on how to use an existing test dataset](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/master/docs/USE_EXISTING_DATA.md)
 - [x] Fork the [nf-core/test-datasets repository](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) to your GitHub account
 - [x] Create a new branch on your fork
 - [x] Check your proposed test data follows the [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/test_data_guidelines)
 - [x] Add your test dataset
   - [x] If you clone it locally use `git clone <url> --branch <branch> --single-branch`
 - [ ] Make a PR on a new branch with a relevant name
 - [ ] Wait for the PR to be merged
 - [ ] Use this newly created branch for your tests
