# How to add new test data

- collect/generate your test dataset
- make sure your test data is working with the module(s) it is designed for
- make a fork of the `nf-core/test-dataset` repository
- add the test data to your fork (checkout and use the `modules` branch)
- make a pull request to the `modules` branch from your fork of `nf-core/test-datasets`
- once the pull request is accepted, you can change the paths to the test data for your module(s) on `nf-core/modules`
