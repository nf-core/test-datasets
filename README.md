# Modules Test Data

This branch of the `nf-core/test-datasets` repository contains all data used for the individual module tests.
There are two main directories: `genomics` and `delete_me`. The former contains all datasets for genomics tools while the latter contains temporary datasets that will be deleted as better data gets available.

### delete_me

The `delete_me` folder does not adhere to a defined structure as data in this folder should be directly as fast as possible, whenever a more suitable dataset is found that can be added to the `genomics` folder.

### genomics

The genomics folder contains subfolders for all organisms for which test data is available. At the moment, there are two organisms available:
    *homo_sapiens
    * sarscov2

The two folders are structured in a similar way, with any genome-specific files in `genome` (e.g. fasta, gtf, ...) and technology specific raw-data files
in the `illumina` and `nanopore` subfolders.
It is currently organised in `genomics` and `generic`. The former contains all typical data required for genomics modules, such as fasta, fastq and bam files. Every folder in `genomics` corresponds to a single organisms. Any other data is stored in `generic`. This contains files that currently cannot be associated to a genomics category, but also depreciated files which will be removed in the future and exchanged by files in `genomics`. For every data file, a short description about how this file was generated is available either in this description or in the respective subfolder.

If you cannot find suitable test data on this repository, please contact us on the [nf-core Slack `#modules` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/modules) (you can join with [this invite](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)). The goal is to create a suitable, small test dataset that should be usable with the available test data and if possible be generated with modules available from `nf-core/modules`. If creating that test data is difficult but you want to add the module first, it is also possible to add a small subset to the `delete_me` folder to get your module tests running, and then add proper test data afterwards. This should be discussed on slack. In order to add test data. For a short description of the workflow for adding new data, have a look at [here](docs/ADD_NEW_DATA.md)
