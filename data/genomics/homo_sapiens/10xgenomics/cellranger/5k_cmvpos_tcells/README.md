# 5k_cmvpos_tcells

Human T cells were isolated from a patient who was previously diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (lot 5147JN21).
Gene Expression, TCR, and Antibody Capture libraries were generated from a single Chromium Connect channel.
Antibody libraries were generated using a combination of a BioLegend TotalSeqâ„¢-C TBNK panel, a CMV dextramer, and a non-binding control dextramer.
The (original) TCR library was downsampled to 5,000 reads per cell.
Libraries were prepared following the Chromium Next GEM Automated Single Cell 5' Reagent Kits v2 User Guide (CG0000507).

Data were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq with 28 bp read 1, 90 bp read 2, 10 bp i5 sample barcode, and 10 bp i7 sample barcode.
